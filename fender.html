    <h1>Why is this guitar so popular?</h1>

  <p>If you’re reading this, hopefully you have time for a little history. If you just want to know the general answer to the question, scroll to the very last paragraph. Thanks!</p>
<p>Of course, all of the specs, features and details (that others have listed) of the Strat have to do with its popularity and ubiquity over the decades. However, these features merely underlie the important circumstances and unique set of variables that aligned during the 1950s to create what we now know as rock n roll and making the Stratocaster a wildly popular guitar platform.</p>
<p>If you weren’t alive back then (like me), try to consider what popular culture and the “music scene” would have been like in the 1940s and 1950s. Distorted guitar sounds that we now know so well only existed as offensive gear malfunctions or as underpowered amplifiers that were being pushed harder by their inputs than their schematics were meant to handle.</p>

  <p>Before the early- mid 1900s, music was still being played in orchestral groups and bands as well as small ensembles of like instruments (eg. Mandolin orchestras). If you weren’t aware, the company we know as Gibson Guitars was previously known as “The Gibson Mandolin and Guitar Company”. Mandolin orchestras were hugely popular in the early 1900s. Acoustic instruments reigned supreme through the 1930s as electric guitars and amplifier technology (and audio tech in general) was still in its infancy.</p>
<p>Soon, instruments were being amplified. Gibson offered hollow-body electric guitars born from their deep roots as acoustic instrument makers. These instruments were constructed with glued in neck joints, arched tops and usually styling that tilted to much more classical designs of the past (spruce tops, flamed maple backs and sides, f holes, etc). Of course, Gibson was not the onlyinstrument manufacturer, just a popular one that is a good reference because people are familiar with the brand. Try to remember that by and large if the average person wanted to listen to music in the early part of the century, you had to seek out live performances or simply play it yourself on an instrument.</p>
