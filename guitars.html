    <ol>
      <li>Start slowly
       <p>Most first time learners will try to play chords as fast as they can. Don’t be tempted to do this.</p>
       <p>Instead, learn each chord slowly, one at a time. Once you’ve mastered a few chord shapes slowly, try moving between them more quickly. This helps you avoid bad habits that come with trying to run before you can walk.</p> </li>
     <li>Avoid the habit of looking at your hands
      <p>For beginners, that urge to look at your hands while playing is almost irresistible.</p>
<p>Although to begin with, it’s important to look at your hands when changing chord, avoid watching your hands constantly.</p>
<p>Looking away from your hands will help you connect to the feeling of a correct chord placement as well as the visual.</p>
<p>To further develop this, try practising looking away or closing your eyes while playing and only look at your hands once in a while to confirm you’re in the right place.</p> </li>
    <li>Practice difficult chords
      <p>By just sticking to the chords you’ve already mastered, you could end up in a rut.</p>
<p>Always challenge yourself with new chords and spend time learning them instead of playing it safe with the easy ones.</p>
<p>Remember, some of the all-time greats (The Beatles included) used variations of chords rather than their basic counterparts, to get their distinctive sounds.</p></li>
